# Phordan's After Effects ScriptUI Panels
Welcome! The `phordan_ae_scripts` repo is where I'm sharing the ScriptUI panels I create for my own needs. When choosing ScriptUI over CEP extensions I usually focus on simple, distributable, single-purpose utilities for techniques I use often or find unique, as well as QC tools like Effect Explorer; I try to make anything I make in ScriptUI as easy to use as possible.

## Scripts:
### [EfExDep Lite](https://github.com/phordan/phordan_ae_scripts/wiki/EfExDep-Lite)
_**Effect Explorer and Dependency Checker**_
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12a9afee-c1cd-427a-ab1b-9413abf435b9)
- A *QC/Troubleshooting tool* that lets you see all the effects used in your project, with options for search-scope and view-grouping.
- The **Dependency Checker** focuses only on **one** Comp, listing _all_ of the unique effect(s) it relies on in this manner:
   - _**"Direct"**_ dependencies, meaning effects used _directly on layers_ in the Target Comp. And...
   - _**"Nested"**_ effect dependencies, meaning effects used in comp(s) the target Comp contains, and is therefore reliant on in order to render in it's intended form.
  
The main **Tree View** is great for hunting down Effect locations down to the effect index of a layer, and generally seeing what fx the project uses, but look to _Dependency Checker_ for an accurate tell of "What effects does this comp need?" when handing off work, prepping to render on a different machine, or other QC situations.

### [Font Wrangler](https://github.com/phordan/phordan_ae_scripts/wiki/Font-Wrangler)
_**Lists fonts used in a comp**_
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1eb67e77-65ad-4418-9f85-467b62b87781)
Shows the fonts used in a single comp.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This script is limited to fonts set on the first character of a text layer.
> It cannot look at fonts set by effects like Numbers, Red Giant effects, etc.
> Workarounds for these cases are being looked into, and suggestions are welcome. 

#### Font Wrangler Changelog:
- **v1.0.1** Mar 05 2025
  - [add] Full Project and Project-Panel-Selection Search Scopes
  - [add/fix] New button to refresh comp dropdown (repopulate list when switching projects or adding/deleting comps)
  - [perf] Comps iterated through properly (standard `for` loop instead of `for...in`)
  - [perf] "Show Fonts" button moved to its own row, misc UI tweaks

  - [TODO] Nested Comp Support (currently only works on top-level comps)
  - [TODO] Expose fonts inside textDocument by searching through every character (Deep/Exhaustive Scan)
  - [TODO] Expose fonts referenced inside Expressions
  - [TODO] Expose fonts referenced inside Effect Properties (Red Giant, Numbers, etc.)
  - [TODO] add Summary/Status text

### [Phil's Toolbox](https://github.com/phordan/phordan_ae_scripts/wiki/Phil's-Toolbox)
_**Various Uncommon Utilities**_  
This is a multi-purpose ScriptUI Panel that has a few different macros related to _applying expressions on properties_. 
It lets you apply some pretty powerful expression-based features I use often pretty easily:
- **Number Formatter**
   - _"Social Media" auto number formatting_, i.e. ` 1,232 -> 1.2k `, ` 6.2M `, ` 526k `, etc.
- **Highlight Hashtags / Hide Emoji**
   - A couple of the Expression Selector utilities I made to help with social media UI templates, but can be applied to other text-highlight situations. Also provides the core functionality for "Fixing the Emoji Problem" when using character indexes in After Effects.
- **Squircle Generator**
   - Generates super-ellipse style "Squircle" rectangle shape made famous by Apple and their refusal to use traditionally-calculated rounded Rectangles.
   - Has controls for size, roundness, and tension (0.5 represents traditional rounded rectangle).
